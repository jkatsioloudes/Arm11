# ARM11

## Motivation
During the summer term all first year undergraduates undertook an ambitious group projects in C to create emulators and assemblers for a subset of ARM11.  The Department then provided us with Raspberry Pi's, some LEDs and resistors, along instructions to boot their assembled programs directly on the Pis, and promised a few marks for "making something interesting".

For three days the markers and guests (including personal tutors, members of CSG and many other interested students) were treated to an impressive set of presentations and demos showing off everything from simple flashing LEDs, Morse code messengers, timing/reaction games and graphical displays.  All the software running on the Pis had been written in ARM assembly and assembled by the student's own tools.
